# Spotify Charts

## Summary

This is the first project I build from the ground up after learning to use React. It works as intended however I have learned a lot about since creating this and am planning on optimzing it by retooling the CSS as SCSS and updating the JS.

The app will prompt the user to log in to spotify and then it will request information about the users listening habits. For infrequent Spotify users the data received from Spotify may be incomplete.

The user also has the option to use an example set of data to see what the app can do with the data from a frequently used account.
